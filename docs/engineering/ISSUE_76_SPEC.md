# VideoPlayer Feature Spec

**Resolves:** #76

This file documents the design for VideoPlayer, located at ` src/Playback/VideoPlayer.h `.

## Goals

- Implement the user-facing behaviour described in the linked issue.
- Keep the public surface small and free of UI-framework specifics in the header.

## Public API (sketch)

`cpp
class VideoPlayer {
public:
    bool Initialize();
    void Shutdown();
    // ...issue-specific methods follow.
};
`

## Dependencies

- CommonTypes.h for shared value types.
- Logging.h for structured diagnostics.
- Other modules as required by the specific feature.
